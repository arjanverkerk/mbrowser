Scripted mpv
============

Here is a setup to use mpv as media browser and very simple selector / editor.


Roadmap
-------

Hopefully more accurate clipping precision (are seconds rounded?) - could try
the ffmpeg noaccurateseek option.



Keys
----

Keys that have no binding in mpv yet:
"abcghkny" + "-=;'"

-=: rotate
;': browse
y: why? undo!
k: remove (kill)
c: create clip
