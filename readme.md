Scripted mpv
============

Here is a setup to use mpv as media browser and very simple selector / editor.


Roadmap
-------

- mpv starts a python worker script.
- add mpv bindings to do simple editing jobs:
    - remove media
    - rotate media
    - add sections of video
- undo functionality for the worker jobs
- use mpv's show-text for any user information
