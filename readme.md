Scripted mpv
============

Here is a setup to use mpv as media browser and very simple selector / editor.


Roadmap
-------

Creating clips!
- how to name the files
- actual ffmpeg command


Keys
----

Keys that have no binding in mpv yet:
"abcghkny" + "-=;'"

-=: rotate
;': browse
y: why? undo!
k: remove (kill)
c: create clip
